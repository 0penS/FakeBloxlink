# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Create a Discord bot: https://discord.com/developers
2. In the developer portal, make sure that all **Privledged Gateway Intents** are enabled
3. Copy the bot token and put it where it says `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` via [main.py](https://github.com/Severitylol/FakeBloxlink/blob/main/main.py)
4. Edit the Settings in the code and run the bot
5. Add the bot to your server with administrator permissions
6. Make a verify channel which tells other users to use the `!verify` command in any channel and it will send them a dm with your Bloxlink "verification link"

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This code is meant to be used for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for what other people decide to do with the code. I will not be helping others in setting this up because it is so simple, but I will be updating the code as the api becomes deprecated over time.
