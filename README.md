# FakeBloxlink
Fake Bloxlink Verification

# Usage
1. Type ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the directory of the folder or in the terminal/shell
2. Create a Discord bot via https://www.discord.com/developers
3. In the developer portal, make sure that all **Privledged Gateway Intents** are enabled
4. Copy the bot token and put it where it says `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` in main.py
5. Edit the Settings in the code and run the bot
6. Add the bot to your server by making a **OAuth2 Url Generator** (Make sure it has administrator permissions)
7. Now make a verify channel which tells other users to use the `!verify` command in any channel and it will send them a dm with your Bloxlink "verification link"
